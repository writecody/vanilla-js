# loan-calculator

Completed exercise from a series of JavaScript tutorials...

## To run this application:
1. Clone this directory's parent `vanilla-js` repository onto your machine.
2. Navigate to the directory `loan-calculator` in your terminal or IDE.
3. From within this `loan-calculator` directory, start a local server on your machine to start the application.
  - Live Server [https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server] is a good tool for this; it can be enabled as an extension in VS Code.
